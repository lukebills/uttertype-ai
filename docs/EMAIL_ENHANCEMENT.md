## üîß Advanced Features

### Debouncing System

The email enhancement includes a 2-second debounce system to prevent:
- Accidental multiple triggers
- Processing conflicts
- System overload

**How it works:**
- First trigger processes normally
- Subsequent triggers within 2 seconds are ignored
- Console shows "debounced" message for ignored triggers

### Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:

```python
try:
    # Email formatting process
    formatted_text = format_for_email(selected_text)
    # Success handling
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error in email formatting: {e}")
    # Fallback to original text
```

### Clipboard Management

The enhancement preserves your original clipboard:

1. **Stores** original clipboard content
2. **Copies** selected text for processing
3. **Processes** text with AI
4. **Replaces** selection with enhanced text
5. **Restores** original clipboard if process fails

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### üìã Enhancement Not Working
**Symptoms:** Nothing happens when pressing the hotkey

**Solutions:**
1. **Select text first** - Must have text highlighted
2. **Check hotkey** - Verify correct key combination
3. **Wait for debounce** - Allow 2 seconds between attempts
4. **Check permissions** - Ensure clipboard access allowed

#### üîÑ Text Not Replacing
**Symptoms:** Enhanced text goes to clipboard but doesn't replace selection

**Solutions:**
1. **Check application compatibility** - Some apps block programmatic paste
2. **Manual paste** - Use `Ctrl+V` to paste manually
3. **Test in different app** - Try in notepad/simple text editor
4. **Check clipboard content** - Enhanced text should be in clipboard

#### ü§ñ Poor Enhancement Quality
**Symptoms:** AI output is not as expected

**Solutions:**
1. **Check original text quality** - Ensure readable source text
2. **Verify API connection** - Test with simple text first
3. **Adjust model settings** - Try different GPT model
4. **Customize prompt** - Modify for specific needs

#### üí∞ API Costs Too High
**Symptoms:** High OpenAI usage charges

**Solutions:**
1. **Use cheaper models** - Switch to `gpt-3.5-turbo`
2. **Optimize usage** - Only enhance when necessary
3. **Set usage limits** - Configure API limits in OpenAI dashboard
4. **Monitor usage** - Track tokens used per enhancement

### Debugging Steps

#### 1. Test Hotkey Detection
```bash
python test_hotkeys.py
```

#### 2. Check Console Output
Look for these messages when triggering enhancement:
```
Email hotkey triggered!
Starting email formatting...
Processing selected text: [text preview]...
Email formatting completed successfully!
```

#### 3. Test Clipboard Operations
```python
import pyperclip

# Test clipboard access
pyperclip.copy("test")
print(pyperclip.paste())  # Should print "test"
```

#### 4. Test AI Processing
```python
from main import format_for_email

test_text = "test email content here"
result = format_for_email(test_text)
print(result)
```
